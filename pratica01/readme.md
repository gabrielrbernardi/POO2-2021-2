# Design principles and bad smells
One of the design principles used to do this exercise was the MVC architecture, where the files needed to build the visualization are separated from the files that control the application, where assignments are made, creating objects. A package was also created in case you had the need to use a connection to an eventual database.  

Regarding bad smells, at first none were found.

Some screenshots of the application are below.
